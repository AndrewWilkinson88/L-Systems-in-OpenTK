The controls on this program are very similar to that
of a FPS without the mouse control:

w = move forward
a = turn left
d = turn right
s = move backward

q = strafe left
e = strafe right

z = move down
c = move up


Also by presing t: you can auto finish the animation
so it goes straight to the end.
